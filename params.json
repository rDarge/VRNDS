To run with your Gear VR you will need to replace the oculus sig file in the plugins folder. Please see https://developer.oculus.com/osig/ to generate your signature file based on your device.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nRight now it's looking like it's just me. Looking for additional authors more versed in audio encoding in order to support more formats on the fly. \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nShoot me a message on Github. \r\n",
